Classifying tweets about COVID-19 impact on education

In this project we used deep learning methods to apply sentiment analysis to a dataset of online learning-related tweets in order to categorize these tweets into positive and negative opinions.
Different model architectures were applied to the dataset. The model was chosen by the best results obtained.

Our data set consists of 507 tweets.  Each data point looks like this:
terridawnarnold;1;@mylearnie @DistanceLrnBot Distance learning may be the future for even more students than before Covid-19. Brick and mortar schools will be modified. At least that is a theory some educators share.

Each column is separated by a semicolon. The first column is the username, the second column is the label, and the last column is the tweet.

If the label is 0, than it is a negative tweet.
If the label is 1, than it is a positive tweet.
