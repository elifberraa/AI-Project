ChloeJonesy1996;0;Kinda sucks that 2 out of my 3 years at Uni(Film School) were during Covid, and felt like such a blur. Most of the time classes were online. I feel like this is the first year that actually feels apart from the past 2 years.;;;;;

Unless urgent action, if the government can still get companies to trust them to pay the bills, is taken to make schools safe. Not just safer, but actually safe, or remote education is 👉;;;;;
ForthHazera;0;@HelenLindop @LaurenHug @TillieElvrum And also, most Primary and Secondary schools did not have the initial infrastructure to be wholly doing online learning nor resources or support for staff to do so. Most teachers were trained for face to face learning so it's unfair to compare with established virtual education.;;;;;

ckg_gmi;0;@efleeka @sode917 @8ellaax I guess it’s probably a matter of opinion then. Personally I think online school isn’t good. Especially when taking difficult a-level subjects like physics. Then again closing schools would be good if the UK has to get rid of covid for good. Tough times either way.;;;;;

bledwine;1;This teacher still can’t smell or taste after 9 months. There are many kids who can’t eat and other long-COVID symptoms. No epidemiologist can say infection is safer than remote school. Asymptomatic damage and spread is real. Kids will live with this for much longer than I will.;;;;;
msoutdoorfisher;0;@breakfasttv I am a teacher and a parent… I am more concerned about the harmful impacts online school has on my kids socially, emotionally, mentally and physically than I am about them getting Covid at school. Kids MUST be in school!;;;;;
Dave72David;1;What happens to a #school if multiple #teachers develop #Covid_19? You can’t socially distance young children. It will spread exponentially through staff and students creating an unworkable learning space. Dangerous. Teachers are not babysitters so parents can go to work. @JaneCaro;;;;;
EveExamines;1;@CHCHNews @AdamCHCH Lots of people can’t face the reality that COVID is actually dangerous.  Also Ford does everything so half assed. A better government could have much better online school.;;;;;
josiahsenu;2;So while I appreciate why some want to move school entirely online due to the public health risks of COVID (entirely understandable), there is something rather irreplaceable about teaching in-person in a room filled with students /3;;;;;
beautiful_oops;2;@SuptJaraCCSD @lindacavazos13 Please don’t risk the lives of our staff and students. Is distance learning perfect, no, but the risks will far out weigh the benefits in the weeks, months, years, dare I say decades as we learn more about the devastating long term effects of COVID.;;;;;

BeccaPiano;0;"@Quillingbee @MDFitness1975 Yes,and increase is due exclusively to, let's see… the wearing of masks?

amylouky;1;@jeff_downen @Boss52KC @farwestchef94 @PamelaHensley22 I'm not going down the rabbit hole of debating covid measures and their legitimacy with you. I survived fine wearing a mask, my kids did fine with online learning and masks at school. Lockdowns were unfortunate but necessary, and again not the Dem's fault. Blame covid.;;;;;
MS_FREGOLI;0;The stress of online school, my family getting covid, my grandma getting hospitalized, the stress of online school, frustration at our ineffective government, the bad thoughts coming back, the stress of online school, my mom doubting my mental health/sexuality...;;;;;
_shreyansh_311;1;@myogiadityanath @CMOfficeUP @AdminLKO Covid Cases in Lucknow have crossed 278 Mark, Students have to go to their school from tomorrow, and that is very risky, school should be closed and online mode should be opted as these children are not even vaccinated.;;;;;
cchotatao;1;Not the two times Thailand experiences rise of covid cases do i mysteriously gets art motivation and also improve so quick😐 hope online school becomes a thing cuz I do NOT want to lose this flow;;;;;
woollyvix;1;I personally think ALL schools should deliver remote learning throughout the whole of Jan, to get Covid rates under control.  I just said to my 9yr old - ‘you’d like a month of mum home school, wouldn’t you?’ Her response - ‘erm, not particularly, thanks’ 😂;;;;;
Ryan42089090;0;@Not_ForNothing @GovMurphy Remote learning is ineffective and worse for the child than the risk for COVID. That’s why. He’s 100% right. Send your kids to school with masks and stop with the irrational fears!!;;;;;
ToniChe67184591;2;There are many privacy acts for online safety in place to protect our children. Educators and our schools/tech depts must make sure to keep their info out of the hands of people that could misuse it. Especially in this COVID-19 world of online learning.  #lifeleader #onlinelearning;;;;;
cv_cev;1;@GYamey @Nature Vulnerable families have been exposed via compulsory face to face education in unsafe schools.  We were told children don't catch or spread Covid. This is incorrect.  Soon, no mitigations in schools. Those prioritised for boosters at increased risk of death still exposed.;;;;;
EdmJbg;1;@latingle The Government should be investing in online public schools. #Covid  Children can be face to face with teachers via screens.   They DON'T need to be in UNSAFE Covid infected classrooms during a pandemic! #StopTheSpread  Let kids socialise outside of school for mental health!  https://t.co/3mpHAtU8Ah;;;;;
JGBeautifulSong;0;@Trishanduke @ABC I don't know why any school opened when Covid numbers are higher now than back in March. Luckily, my town realizes this and schools here will only be online. A disappointment for my daughter, but at least I know my grandkids will be safer!;;;;;
MphoMfolo;0;...Online classes for the next 3 days. I hate Covid so much for taking away the physical attendance of class. These online things are tedious 🙄 but we move!;;;;;

jentwinkle;1;@oi_tillymint @PhilipHollobone @fact_covid I caught covid at work in a primary school. All year groups had cases, many staff infected. Some (inc me) still not well enough to return. What happens when more staff are infected and unable to work? Much better to switch to remote learning before that happens surely?;;;;;
learnin_as_i_go;1;@maria_lamb_ @MartinSLewis Everybody wants restrictions to end but this gov't have done their best to accommodate covid and we've been living restricted lives ever since. I'd prefer to see schools go to remote learning and everyone out and about wearing an N95 mask, wfh,local tandt.Johnson/Javid/Nazawi out.;;;;;
Joonuper;0;Another email from @LakeWashSchools and another disappointment. In one of the tech hubs of the world, they’ve decided remote learning won’t work, and won’t be rolling it out. AT ALL. So let me lay this out as someone with underlying health issues: #COVID19seattle #Covid_19;;;;;
lisesnavlar3;1;Hello I reach you from Turkey our minister of national education ziya Selçuk wants to do the exams face-to-face but covid-19 is very common and dangerous please be our voice! @WHO @DrTedros  #NoticeTurkishStudents;;;;;
king_of_kul;1;@RepublicanNgr I agreed with baba, but where is the money to finance all these things, economy still remain closed, even govt still own some lectures, I'll prefer online class via google class for now, you know to cover up before covid 19 end;;;;;

dyreatic;0;I do think it was a little bit of a waste that the author didn't explore the other challenges related to the start of COVID too deeply. I mean yes, remote learning and being alone sucks (which is conveniently somewhat solved by moving in with someone else),;;;;;
bacpau;2;@MundayRex @Dr_PhilippaW @RishiSunak The teachers I know worked their socks off planning and delivering online learning when they couldn't be in school. Since schools opened they've coped with the demands of normal schooling together with managing the risks of covid  transmission.;;;;;
CherylLudwig1;1;@KellieDBrown1 I stand with you on this and I also am emotionally in the same fetal position. My face-to-face school hasn't masked all year. Most of the kids in my class have had COVID already. I just sent two more home this morning. Sad and dangerous. No words.;;;;;

swatikim1;1;@DOEChancellor You really need to offer a remote options. Especially for kids that live in house with immunocompromised family members. My 6yr old was exposed in school on 1/4/22 and tested positive for Covid. We are all positive now. This is very frustrating and dangerous.;;;;;

calumhoodsfarts;0;@COMFYS1LENCE it was so boring bc we have to do online school for like 2 weeks bc of covid ans i literally did nothing the whole time and all the meeting were so awkward LMAO;;;;;
vijayinsb;2;@SCE Re: Outage # 1128388 (Jan 23, 2020) - please consider rescheduling at night or a weekend day. Due to COVID-19 a lot of us are working from home and the children are doing remote learning for school . It also impacts the heating in the house. Thank you;;;;;
rickscheibner;0;My takeaway from #asca2020 thus far: Tier 1 is the new Tier 2. Universal needs assessments are going to be key in the age of distance learning amid Covid. The school counseling program is more critical than ever. This is not a drill. @ascatweets #scchat;;;;;
moira228;1;@MassGovernor @iHealthLabsUS @FedEx THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION.  Once again, we are asking teachers to do something dangerous and potentially deadly, go back into schools rife with Covid.  First school shootings, then remote learning, then go back before Vaccines.  YOU ARE ENDANGERING OUR TEACHERS AND EVERYONE ELSE.;;;;;

MrNMath;0;@ColeSouth @ikepoker @bp22 @T_Rutt @BalognaSangwich @ChaseAllanArch1 A lot of the mandatory covid policies, especially in the area of K-12 education (whole school districts being fully remote for all of 2020-2021) went completely against what science was showing.  A complete refusal to update your priors.;;;;;
speechboy71;0;Yes. Remote learning and being away from friends is far more dangerous to the mental health of kids and their educational development than COVID.;;;;;
ParsleyJust;0;I DID ANOTHER COVID TEST, IM NEGATIVE Y'ALL IM SO HAPPY BC ONLINE SCHOOL WAS SO BORING;;;;;
monkeymolotovs;1;Our class was exposed to COVID so we have to go remote for a few days. It was inevitable. It’s just not safe to be in person right now.;;;;;
LisaDani;0;@GraceCordovano @GailYentaBeck So true, Grace. Kids and teens being at home for so long are struggling...the disappointment of hoping for school or college in person yet fear of COVID, then changed to online. It's confounding. We're doing regular facetime etc w my niece and nephew and immediate family #hcldr;;;;;
GentleMoonbeam;0;there are completely reasonable reasons why I started struggling significantly more when school went online. covid was hard mentally. I don't have separate spaces for work and leisure. I don't have any safeguards. I was experimenting with dosages of adhd meds and antidepressants.;;;;;
linotiddiez;0;@rachasblo im the only one online for school cuz i had covid cant wait to go back its so boring;;;;;
cv_cev;1;@laurabundock @laurabundock We urgently need to avoid repeating mistakes with new, potential vaccine escape, variant threatening this Winter.

SqueakyToyArts;0;But I feel I will be eventually and my brain is convinced we'll all die. I know I'm quick to become depressed and mentally unwell to where I don't do anything but sleep for weeks and nothing else. I've done it during covid when I had to online school, I didn't do shit.;;;;;
Mr_Loeb;0;For far too many of our kids remote learning is not learning at all. It is a depressing daily grind and a nightmare for our families. We know much more about #COVID today than in 2020 and we must use this knowledge to do everything we can to keep school buildings safely open.;;;;;
annjsmall;1;@chrisdysonHT @MrLThomas What about staff, unsafe working environment, family members hospitalised, long covid, death,  Children now suffering #longcovidkids it worth a face to face lesson right now, open for key workers, vulnerable, or blended learning but not how it is now, it's terrifying.;;;;;
